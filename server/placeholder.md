Just here to take up space and make sure this folder gets uploaded

I think this folder is going to either hold the websocket or simply not exist

I think websocket functionality would be cool if the user wants to get realtime updates about when trash is deposited or when they've met their goals (like they don't have to reopen the app/refresh the page type beat)
